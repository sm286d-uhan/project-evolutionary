The world's largest package delivery company found that it could save time and fuel if it rerouted its fleet of trucks so that they only made right turns rather than waiting to make left turns against oncoming traffic. By 2012, the rule, along with some other improvements to its operations, had saved 10 million gallons of gasoline &mdash; the equivalent of taking 5300 cars off the road for a year!

    "Imagine a sales professional who needs to leave their office, travel to a collection of clients, and return to the office. What is the shortest or fastest path that visits all clients and returns to the office? In some cases, the salesperson might need to travel long distances, visiting clients in different cities before returning home. Whether our goal is to minimize the time spent traveling or the cost spent visiting clients, the problem is essentially the same. There is a list of locations (often thought of as cities), including the home city, and a matrix whose $(i,j)$ entry encodes the distance or cost from city $i$ to city $j$. Our goal is to find an order to visit the cities that minimizes the distance traveled, including the distance from the last city back to the first city. "

    "While it might seem most efficient to always travel to the closest city that hasn't yet been visited, there are many examples where this approach does not yield the minimum distance route. The TSP became popular in the USA during the 1950's and 1960's, when the RAND  Corporation offered cash prizes for its solution. In 1972, Richard Karp showed that the TSP is *NP-hard*, which explains why solving the TSP with many cities is often incredibly difficult. You will study various algorithms for solving the TSP in SA405 &mdash; Advanced Mathematical Programming. "

    "We're going to use a heuristic &mdash; an evolutionary algorithm &mdash; to find good solutions to the TSP. The method doesn't necessarily produce the best solution, but it is fast and flexible and often produces acceptable solutions within a few seconds. The method is inspired by the process of biological evolution in which each generation of parents mates to produce children who share some of the parents' characteristics. The fittest of these children survive to mate and produce the next generation of children. After many generations, the children are often exceptionally fit. We need not be completely faithful to this biological inspiration. We are free to entertain models in which a single parent produces children, or situations where three or more parents are required to produce children. There are also many ways to define and use fitness. In addition, we might find ways to improve the children -- allowing them to develop into adults -- before imposing our selection procedure. "
